<h2 id="YELLOW_BUTTERFLIES">YELLOW BUTTERFLIES</h2>


<p>Out from the door of the house
burst the laughing, shouting
little lad. He raced across the
grass and halted by the tulip-bed;
there, with yet more shouts of full-throated
baby laughter, he turned to
look back at his young mother, racing
after him, standing now in the
doorway. His head was yellow as a
flower, almost as yellow as the tulips,
and the spun-silk, glittering hair of
five years old curled tight in a manner
of aureole. As the girl gazed at
him, glorying in him, suddenly the
sun came brilliantly from under a
cloud, and, as if at a signal, out of the
clover-patch at the edge of the lawn
stormed a myriad of butterflies and
floated about the golden head.</p>

<p>“Oh, the butterflies take you for a
flower, Dicky,” cried the girl.</p>

<p>The little chap stood quite still,
smiling and blinking through the
winged sunshine, and then, behold,
three or four of the lovely things
fluttered down on his head. The
young woman flashed out and caught
him and hugged him till he squealed
lustily.</p>

<p>“Don’t, muvver,” remonstrated
Dicky. “You’ll scare my ’ittle birds.
They ’ike us, muvver.”</p>

<p>“It’s good luck to have a butterfly
light on you,” she informed him, and
then, in a flash of some unplaced
memory, with the quick mysticism of
her Irish blood: “A butterfly is the
symbol of immortality.”</p>

<p>“’Esh,” agreed Dicky gravely.
“’Esh a ’sympum&mdash;” and there he
lost himself, and threw back his head
and roared rich laughter at the droll
long word.</p>

<p>“It must have looked pretty,” the
boy’s father agreed that night. “I
wonder what sort they were. I used
to collect them. There’s a book&mdash;”
He went to the shelves and searched.
“This is it.” There were pages here
and there of colored pictures. “No.
2,” he read, and pointed to a list.
“The Cloudless Sulphur. Were they
solid yellow?” He turned a page.
“‘The Cloudless Sulphur,’” he began
reading aloud. “‘Large, two and
a half inches. Wings uniform bright
canary color. Likely to light on yellow
flowers; social; it flies in masses
and congregates on flowers. Habit of
migrating in flocks from Southeast
to Northwest in the spring and from
Northwest to Southeast in the autumn.
Food, cassia, etc. Family,
Pieridæ.’ That’s the fellow,” decided
the boy’s father, learned in butterflies.
“A Pierid. ‘Many butterflies
hide under clover,’” he read along,
“‘and down in grasses&mdash;pass the
nights there. Some sorts only come
out freely in sunshine.’ Didn’t you
say the sun came?”</p>

<p>“All at once. They flew up then
as if at a command.” She nodded.
“That’s exactly the creature. And
where it says about lighting on flowers
of the same color&mdash;they did take
Dicky’s head for a flower, didn’t
they, Tom?”</p>

<p>“It certainly seems as if they did.”
The man smiled. “Kentucky is likely
on the line of their spring migration
Northwesterly. I reckon Dicky’s
friends are the Cloudless Sulphur.”</p>

<p>Dicky’s father died when the boy
was eleven. The years ran on. Life
adjusted itself as life must, and the
child grew, as that other Child twenty
centuries back, in wisdom and stature
and in favor with God and man.
There might have been more boys in
America as upstanding in body and
character, as loving and clever and
strong and merry, as beautiful within
and without as her boy, the woman
considered, but she had never seen
one. His very faults were dear human
qualities which made him more
adorable. With his tenderness and
his roughness, his teachableness and
his stubbornness, his terror of sentiment
and his gusts of heavenly sweet
love-making, the boy satisfied her to
the end of her soul. Buoyancy found
her again, and youth, and the joy of
an uphill road with this gay, strong
comrade keeping step along it. Then
the war came. All his life she had
missed no chance to make her citizen
first of all things an American. And
now that carefully fed flame of patriotism
flamed to cover all America.</p>

<p>“We must go in, mother. Gosh!
it’s only decent. We could bring
peace. We must go in,” he raged. He
was too young to go across and he
raged more at his youth. His mother
gloried in and shivered at his rage.
At last America was in, and the boy,
who had trained in his university,
could not fling himself fast enough
into the service. The woman, as hundreds
of thousands of other American
women, was no slacker. There was a
jingle in the papers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“America, he is my only one,</div>
<div class="verse">My hope, my pride, and joy;</div>
<div class="verse">But if I had another</div>
<div class="verse">He should march beside his brother,</div>
<div class="verse">America, here’s my boy!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The jingle hit straight at armies of
women in those days.</p>

<p>No officers’ training-camp for Dick;
he would go as an enlisted man with
the rank and file of American men.</p>

<p>“But you’re officer material,” complained
his mother. “Aren’t you
wasting power that the country may
need?”</p>

<p>“If I can win shoulder-bars, honey,
hooray!” said Dick. “Otherwise, me
for a dough-boy.”</p>

<p>So as a dough-boy he went to Camp
Meade, but in three months wore the
stripes of a sergeant. Radiant, he
tumbled in at home a week later,
such a joyful lad that he sputtered
ecstasy and slang. Tremendous he
looked in his uniform, fresh colored
from cold barracks and constant exercise
and in an undreamed pink of
condition.</p>

<p>“I never considered you a delicate
person,” the woman spoke up to the
six feet two of him, “but now you’re
overpowering, you’re beefy.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t kill me with an axe,”
assented Dick cheerfully, and back
in her brain a hideous, unformed
thought stirred, of things that were
not axes, that could kill easily even
this magnificent young strength.</p>

<p>They were as gay together as if all
the training and the uniform and the
stir and panoply of war were merely
a new and rather thrilling game. She
saw to it that there were theatres and
dances and girls doing, and the lad
threw himself into everything with,
however, a delicious grumble after
each party:</p>

<p>“I don’t get a chance to see you at
all.” That was music.</p>

<p>And then the short, gay leave was
done and Dick back at Meade again.
The winter months went, with letters
thickly coming and going. And late
in May he wrote that he had leave
once more for two days, and instantly
he was there. There was no word
as to what the sudden leave meant,
but they knew. When it was possible
our soldiers due to sail were given
this short flying visit to their homes.
Transports were going all the time
now; great ship followed great ship
till it seemed as if the Atlantic must
be brown with khaki. And not the
nearest of any must know when his
time was, for this was one bit of the
national patriotism, to guard the
knowledge of sailing ships from the
enemy. So the boy told nothing, but
his eyes embraced her with a burning
word unspoken. And her eyes
met them with certain knowledge.</p>

<p>“Let’s cut out the girls and balls
this time,” he said. And one day,
apropos of nothing: “You’re a
peach.”</p>

<p>She smiled back cheerfully as women
were smiling at boys all over the
United States at that date. “I couldn’t
bear it if you weren’t in the service,”
she said.</p>

<p>In a few minutes&mdash;it appeared&mdash;the
two days were over. “Run across for
one second and say good-by to Lynnette,”
she suggested, when the racing
hours were within three of their
end. Lynnette was the girl next door
who had grown up in the shadow of
Dick’s bigness, a little thing two
years younger, shy and blunt and not
just a pretty girl, but with luminous
eyes and a heart of gold. Dick had to
be prodded a bit to be nice to Lynnette.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to miss one second of
you, honey,” he objected.</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare stay over a second.
But a glimpse would mean a
lot to her, and she’s a darling to
me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” agreed Dick. “Because
she’s a darling to you&mdash;” and
he swung off.</p>

<p>“Dick&mdash;” as he sprang from the
gallery. He turned. “Kiss her good-by,
Dick.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a mother&mdash;&mdash;!”</p>

<p>“She’ll object, but she’ll like it.”</p>

<p>“You little devil,” Dick chuckled,
“can’t you let a fellow handle his
own kissing?” And started again,
easy, elastic, made of sliding muscles.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dick!” called his mother once
more, and once more the brown figure
halted. “Now, then, woman?”</p>

<p>“Don’t peck, Dick; kiss her a thorough
one.”</p>

<p>Dick’s laughter rang across the little
place. The echo of that big laughter
in the woman was not a quickened
pulse of gladness as it had been
all his days; a sick aching answered
the beloved sound, and the stab of a
thought&mdash;would ever Dick laugh
across the garden again? With that
he was back, grinning.</p>

<p>“I did it,” stated Dick. “It’s not
often a chap’s commanding officer
sends him out with orders for a kissing
attack, so I put my elbows into
it and made a good job. She’s
kissed to pieces.”</p>

<p>“Dick!”</p>

<p>“Well, now! It’ll teach you to go
careful how you start a man on them
tricks. Lynnette’s a worthy child,
but I’d never have thought of kissing
her. Yet it wasn’t so bad. Rather
subtle.” He licked his lips tentatively.</p>

<p>“Dicky! Vulgar, vulgar boy!”</p>

<p>“You know, I believe she did like
it,” confided Dick.</p>

<p>Then very soon, in the middle of the
sunshiny, warm morning he went.
In the hall, where they had raced and
played games long ago, she told him
good-by, doing a difficult best to give
him cheer and courage to remember,
not heart-break. Something helped
her unexpectedly, reaction, maybe, of
a chord overstrained; likely the good
Lord ordered it; His hand reaches
into queer brain-twists. She said
small, silly things that made the boy
laugh, till at last the towering figure
was upon her and she was crushed
into khaki, with his expert rifleman’s
badge digging into her forehead. She
was glad of the hurt. The small defenses
had gone down and she knew
that only high Heaven could get her
through the next five seconds with
a proper record as a brave man’s
mother. In five seconds he turned and
fled, and with a leap was through the
door. Gone! She tossed out her arms
as if shot, and fled after him. Already
he was across the lawn, by the
tulip-bed, and suddenly he wheeled
at the patch of color and his visored
cap was off, and he was kissing his
hand with the deep glow in his eyes
she had seen often lately. It was as if
the soul of him came close to the
windows and looked out at her. His
blond hair in the sunlight was almost
as yellow as on that other day
long ago when&mdash;What was this? Up
from the clover in the ditch, filling
all the air with fluttering gold,
stormed again a flight of yellow butterflies,
the Cloudless Sulphur on
their spring migration. The boy as he
stood looking back at her shouted
young laughter and the winged things
glittered about him, and with that
two lighted on his head.</p>

<p>“Good luck! It’s for good luck,
mother,” he called.</p>

<p>She watched, smiling determinedly,
dwelling on details, the uniform, the
folds of brown wool puttees, the
bronze shine on his shoes, the gold
spots of light flickering about his
head. He wheeled, stumbling a bit,
and then the light feet sprang away;
there was no Dick there now, only a
glimmering, moving cloud of yellow&mdash;meaningless.
The tulip-bed&mdash;sunshine&mdash;butterflies&mdash;silence.
The
world was empty. She clutched at her
chest as if this sudden, sick, dropping
away of life were physical. His
triumphant last word came back to
her, “It’s for good luck, mother”;
then other words followed, words
which she had spoken years ago.</p>

<p>“And for immortality.”</p>

<p>Immortality! She beat her hands
against the wall. Not Dick&mdash;not her
boy&mdash;her one thing. Not immortality
for him, yet. Not for years and
years&mdash;fifty&mdash;sixty. He had a right
to long, sweet mortal life before that
terrible immortality. She wanted him
mortal, close, the flesh and blood
which she knew. It was not to be
borne, this sending him away to&mdash;Oh,
God! The thousands on thousands
of strong young things like
Dick who had already passed to that
horrible, unknown immortality. The
word meant to her then only death,
only a frantic terror; the subtle, underlying,
enormous hope of it missed
her in the black hour.</p>

<p>A letter came next day from camp,
and the next, and every day for a
week, and she pulled herself together
and went about her busy hours minute
by minute cheerfully, as one
must. She disregarded the fact that
inside of her an odd mental-moral-spiritual-physical
arrangement which
is called a heart lay quite defenseless,
and that shortly a dagger was going
to be struck into it. So when the dagger
came, folded in a yellow Western
Union envelope, it was exactly as bad
as if there had been no preparation at
all. Dick had sailed. She spun about
and caught at a table. And then went
on quietly with the five hundred little
cheese-cloth “sponges” which she
had promised to have at the Red
Cross rooms to-morrow. Ghastly little
things. So the boy went, one of
two million to go, but yet, as most of
the others were, the only one. And
two weeks later, it might be, came
another telegram; a queerly worded
thing from the war office:</p>

<p>“The ship on which I sailed has arrived
safely in port.”</p>

<p>What ship? What port? After
what adventures? But the great fact
remained; he was, at least, overseas,
beyond the first great peril. She flung
herself into war work and wrote
every day a letter with its vague
military address ending in A. E. F.
And got back many letters full of enthusiasm,
of adventure, of old friends
and new, of dear French people who
had been good to him&mdash;but everybody
was good to this boy. Of hard
training, too, and a word of praise
from high quarters once or twice,
passed on secretly, proudly to the one
person to whom a fellow could repeat
such things. It was a life crowded
with happiness and hardship and
comradeship and worth-while work.
And then, soon, with danger. Through
all sordidness and horror it was a life
vitalized by enormous incentive, a
life whose memory few of those who
lived it would give up for everything
else that any career might offer. The
power of these gay, commonplace,
consecrated boys’ lives reached across
oceans and swung nations into consecration.
Dick’s mother moved gladly
in the huge orbit, for war work meant
to her Dick. The days went. He was
in action at times now, and wrote
that his life was a charmed one, and
that he walked safe through dangers;
wrote also the pitiful bit of statistics
which boys all told to their mothers,
about the small percentage of killed
and wounded; wrote as well the
heroic sweet thoughts which came
from depths of young souls which had
never before known these depths.</p>

<p>“If I’m killed, darling child, honey,
after all it’s not much different. It
wouldn’t be really long before we’d
be playing together again. And I’ve
had the joy and the usefulness of
fifty years of living in these last
months. What more could you ask?
The best thing to do with a life is to
give it away&mdash;you taught me that&mdash;and
this certainly is the best way to
give it, for our America. And don’t
worry about my suffering if I’m
wounded; there’s not much to that.
Things hurt and you stand it&mdash;that
happens in every life&mdash;and we wiggle
and get through. It hurt like the
dickens when I had pneumonia, don’t
you remember? So, behold the
straight dope of the wise man Dick,
and follow thereby. Nothing can happen
that’s unbearable; keep it in your
mind, precious. Live on the surface&mdash;don’t
go feeling any more than you
can help.”</p>

<p>Thousands of others found the
sense of that sentence a way out of
impossibility, as this woman did. She
slept nights and worked days and
wrote letters and rejoiced in getting
them, and shunned like poison
thoughts that thronged below the
threshold, thoughts she dared not
meet. Weeks wore on, months; the
Germans were being pushed back;
with a shivering joy she heard people
say that the war could not last
long; he might&mdash;he might come home
safe. She knew as that shaft of golden
hope winged across her brain, from
the reeling rapture of it she knew how
little hope she had ever had. But she
whispered Dick’s wise sentence once
in a while, “Nothing can happen
that’s unbearable,” and she held her
head high for Dick. Then the one
thing which had never entered her
mind happened. Dick was reported
among the missing.</p>

<p>Missing.</p>

<p>Let any mother of a boy consider
what that means. Anything. Everything.
“Nothing can happen that’s
unbearable,” said Dick. But this was.
A woman can’t stay sane and face
that word “missing”&mdash;can she? This
woman gasped that question of herself.
Yet she must stay sane, for Dick
might come back. Oh, he might even
come back safe and sound. They did
come through prison camps&mdash;sometimes&mdash;and
get back to health. Prison
camps. She fell to remembering
about nights when she had crept into
his room to see that he was covered
up. Mines. But that thought she
could not think. And the difficult
days crawled on, and no news came
and no more gay letters, with their
little half-sentences of love-making,
shining like jewels out of the pages,
pages each one more valuable than
heaps of gold. No letters; no news;
swiftly and steadily her fair hair was
going gray. The Armistice arrived,
and then, after a while, troops were
coming home. Because Dick would
have wanted it, because she herself
must honor these glorious lads who
were, each one, somehow partly Dick,
she threw herself into the greetings,
and many a boy was made happy
and welcome by the slim, tall, still-young
woman with the startling
white hair, who knew so well what to
say to a chap. Outwardly all her ways
stayed the same. No one of her friends
noticed a difference except that
sometimes one would say: “I wonder
what keeps her going? Does she hope
yet that Dick may come back?”
Surely she hoped it. She would not
wear black. Till certainty came she
must hope. Still, little by little, as
drop by drop her heart’s blood
leaked, she was coming to believe
him dead; coming nearly to hope it.
At the same time in the tortured, unresting
brain, the brain that held so
large an area of mysticism from Irish
forbears, in that cave of weaving
thoughts there was still hope of a
miracle. The child next door, Lynnette,
not realizing to what a dangerous
borderland of sanity she was urging
desperate footsteps, helped her
frame her vague theory of comfort.</p>

<p>“Nothing is sure yet. They don’t
begin to know about all the missing,”
argued Lynnette, dark eyes shining.
“Dick may have been carried to the
ends of the earth; he may not know
even now that the war is over. He’s
so strong, nothing could&mdash;could hurt
him,” stammered Lynnette, and went
scarlet with a stab of knowledge of
things, things that even Dick’s splendid
body could not weather.</p>

<p>“Miracles do happen. Do you know,
Lynnette, it’s as if somebody whispered
that to me over and over. ‘Miracles
do happen&mdash;miracles do happen.’
My brain aches with that sentence.”
She was still a moment. “I
saw what you were thinking. Of the&mdash;otherwise.
I can’t face the&mdash;otherwise.”
Her voice thinned to a whisper.
“It’s worse than death, any
possible otherwise, now. When all the
prisoners are freed and all the soldiers
are coming&mdash;home. Lynnette&mdash;I
hope he’s dead.”</p>

<p>The girl tossed up a hand.</p>

<p>“Yes, child. But suffering&mdash;I can’t
have him suffering&mdash;long pain. It
can’t be. Oh, God, don’t let it be
that!”</p>

<p>Lynnette’s brown head dropped on
the woman’s two hands and she
kissed them with passion.</p>

<p>“I’ve got another thought, honey-child,
and I’ll try to tell you, but it’s
complicated.” She was silent again,
reviewing the waves of the ocean of
her theory. The aching, unending
thoughts had been busy with this
theory. Harmlessly, unnoticed, the
mind overwrought had been developing
a mania. Peace. Had her boy, had
all the boys, died for nothing? They
went, the marching hundreds of
thousands, with an ideal; no one who
talked to any number of soldiers of
our armies could fail to know that
latent in practically all was an unashamed
idealism. The roughest specimen
would look you in the eye and&mdash;spitting
first likely&mdash;make amazing
statements about saving the world,
about showing ’em if Americans
would fight for their flag, about paying
our debt to France, and, yes&mdash;in
a quiet, matter-of-fact way&mdash;about
dying for his country.</p>

<div class="verse outdent">“To every man a different meaning, yet</div>

<div class="verse">Something above the blood and dirt and sweat,</div>
<div class="verse">Something apart. May God forget the rest.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The woman, appealing and winning,
had seen this side of the enlisted man
more than most; she had brooded over
it, and over what was due to four millions
of boys giving themselves to
save the peace of the world. Shouldn’t
peace, after such sacrifice, be assured?
Should the great burnt offering
fail? Should the war-to-end-war
lead to other wars? God forbid.
By infinite little links she came to tie
her boy’s coming home to the coming
of world peace. What more typical of
America could there be than Dick?
An enlisted man&mdash;she rejoiced in
that now; of the educated classes, but
representing the rank and file as well
as the brains and gentle blood of this
land; not too poor, yet not rich; in
his youth and strength and forthgoing
power the visible spirit of a
young, strong, eager country. She
put all this into halting yet clear
enough words to the girl.</p>

<p>“I see,” Lynnette picked up the
thread. “Dick is America. He’s a
symbol. Nobody else could combine
so many elements as Dick.”</p>

<p>“I think you understand. It’s wonderful
to be able to tell it to some one
who understands. It has eaten my
soul.” She breathed fast. “Listen&mdash;this
is what, somehow, I believe, and
nothing could change my belief. Dick
is going to bring peace to his country
and to the world. God has chosen
<i>him</i>&mdash;Dick. Alive or dead his coming
will mean&mdash;peace. Peace!” The visions
of many generations of mystic
Gaels were in her eyes as they lifted
and gazed out at the branches which
swayed slowly, hypnotically across a
pale sky. The girl’s twisting hands
holding hers, she went on to unroll
the fabric which had woven itself on
the unresting loom of her brain, a
fabric which was, judged by a medical
standard, madness. The chain of
crooked logic was after this fashion:
America was the nation to bring at
the last peace; Dick was the typical
American; with his home-coming
peace would come home to the country,
and so to the world. Till Dick
came home there could be no surety,
no rest for the flag which he served.
Other women died or went mad; this
one alone, perhaps, fashioned her sorrow
into a vigil for the salvation of
her land.</p>

<p>Then one day Lynnette flew across
the lawn and stood before her.
“You’ve seen the paper?”</p>

<p>“I went to the Red Cross early. I
haven’t read it.” Her pulse stopped.
“Lynnette! Not&mdash;Dick?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no&mdash;oh, no!” Lynnette went
crimson painfully. Another girl would
have had her arms around the woman,
but not this one. To show feeling
was like pulling teeth to Lynnette.
“It’s not that,” she said. “But&mdash;there’s
to be a peace conference. You
know. And they want to bring back
for us at that time, Armistice Day, an
unknown soldier.”</p>

<p>“The two things.” Yes&mdash;the two
things. What could the two things
mean but her vision, her hope for the
world. Dick was coming. He was to be
the unknown soldier. Dick was coming,
carrying peace in his dead hands.
Who else could it be? People, mere
people, could not see how that was
fitting and inevitable; but she saw it;
she knew it; God would take care of
it. The unknown soldier would be
Dick. He would bring, mystically,
certainly, success to the gathering in
Washington. And the Lord God
would give her a sign. Each day she
rose hoping the sign might be that
day. Each night she lay down sure of
its coming, willing to wait.</p>

<p>“Lynnette, I’ll wear&mdash;those clothes,
now.”</p>

<p>And when the girl came across the
lawn and found her a few days later
in new black, with the dramatic gold
star on her arm, Lynnette dropped
suddenly in a heap.</p>

<p>“Oh,” the woman cried. “You
hadn’t given up hope.” And then:
“Lynnette&mdash;you loved Dicky, too.”</p>

<p>With that Lynnette was standing
before her, her head high, a trembling
smile on her face. “I always loved
him. And now I may tell you&mdash;he
loved me.” The woman stared.
“Yes,” Lynnette said. “I didn’t
dream it till that last morning, when
he ran across&mdash;and he kissed me.
He’d never kissed me before. It&mdash;it
wasn’t just a little kiss to&mdash;an old
playmate.” The words came difficultly.
“It&mdash;would be impossible to
tell it except to you. But it was&mdash;a
long kiss. He&mdash;didn’t say anything.
I’ve thought it over and over and
I think he&mdash;believed he shouldn’t.
Somehow. But that kiss&mdash;said it.
For me. I know Dick&mdash;loved me.”</p>

<p>The woman caught the small figure
so that the wet eyes could not see her.</p>

<p>“My Lynnette!” Never on earth
should the child know the true story
of Dick’s kiss.</p>

<p>Then it was November and she
went to Washington. It meant saving
money for months, but there was
no question; the journey was as inevitable
as death. Likely the Lord
waited in Washington with that sign
which she would know when it came.
Many American women are tall and
slender, with lines of distinction; this
was one of them. In her sombre dress
with sheer white at neck and wrists,
with the shadowy veil falling and
lifting about her shoulders and accenting
her white hair, with her lithe
young movement, and with that
touch of mysticism, of other-worldness
in eyes that shone jewel-gray
from a carved face, she was an arresting
person. In great Washington,
packed with all human sorts, people
turned to look at her.</p>

<p>“The gold star! The black&mdash;the
veil! What a face of tragedy!” Such
things they said; more than once a
man’s hand crept to his hat, and he
stood bareheaded as she passed, as
before the dead. But she who had
lived for three years facing an unthinkable
word drifted through the
crowd unconscious, uncaring.</p>

<p>A newspaper had printed a composite
photograph of twenty-nine
young soldiers, one from each of the
combat divisions in France, and at
breakfast in the hotel a woman whom
she had never seen stepped across and
laid it, the picture folded out, by her
plate.</p>

<p>“It’s your boy, too,” the woman
spoke gently, and was gone.</p>

<p>Dick’s mother stared at the vague,
lovely face of an uncommonly handsome
lad, dreamy, deep-eyed, steady-mouthed,
a face rather short from
brow to chin, with a wide facial arch
between the cheek-bones&mdash;such as
was Dick’s face. The sweet extreme
of youth was like Dick, but a certain
haunting, ethereal quality was not
like him; yet, even so might her boy
look at her through the veil of another
world. There was in fact a
manner of likeness, and to the woman
whose soul was at white heat the
likeness was the voice of Heaven saying
“Amen” to her possessing
thought. Yet this was not the sign.
She would know that when it came.
This was but an incident, making
sure faith surer.</p>

<p>All the steps of his journey home
she had watched Dick&mdash;the Unknown.
When the papers had told
how Sergeant Younger, over there in
France at Châlons-sur-Marne, on
October 24th, would be sent into a
room of the city hall alone, to choose
one of four nameless dead boys lying,
each so helpless to plead his cause, in
four earth-stained coffins, she had
known well, even then, which one.
Over Dick’s quiet heart the Sergeant
would lay the white roses. The
French town decked with the colors
of the Allies; troops about the city
hall; an American flag at half-mast;
an unseen band playing on muffled
trumpets&mdash;all this while the Sergeant
walked slowly through the still room
where the dead boys waited, and
walked slowly back and turned and
went to the farthest on the right.
Dick. He bent and laid down the
white French roses&mdash;over Dick. She
was sorry about the other boys, yet
Dick meant all of them. It was ordered.
Dick was the Peace Bringer.
She read how the inscription carried
the words: “An Unknown American
who gave his life in the
World War.” She smiled a little to
think how she alone in the world
knew the Unknown; how among
more than two thousand unidentified
soldiers buried on the battlefields
where they fell, chosen by
chance so that even the field where he
had fallen might never be placed&mdash;she
smiled to think how through this
mist of circumstance she knew Dick.
The woman was mad, it might have
been said, had any one known her
full thought; who among us, with
imagination, but hides a small corner
of madness from the world?</p>

<p>Flower-heaped, carrying the cross of
the Legion of Honor, moving like
the mightiest king through weeping
throngs, Dick came to the gray old
cruiser <i>Olympia</i>, where Dewey had
once said: “You may fire now, Gridley,
if you are ready.” And they carried
him on board, and a General
was his escort home, and a guard of
his comrades stood about him day
and night as he slept among the flags,
his faded French roses above his
breast. The cruiser had steamed out
from Havre through dipped flags and
firing guns, and all the way across the
Atlantic she was saluted by all ships
large and small which sailed within
vision. Because she carried Dick.
With that it was November 9th and
a raw, foggy, rainy day, but the
woman went out from city noises, in
the wet, where it was quiet, to listen
for something. After a while she
heard it&mdash;a far boom of guns&mdash;salutes
to the <i>Olympia</i> as she came
slowly up the Potomac. The fog hid
her, but fort after fort, post after
post, took up the tale and thundered
its solemn welcome to the nation’s
dead boy. The boy’s mother was at
the Navy Yard when the ship swung
into dock. She saw the crew, standing
high up, in dark-blue lines, stiff, at
attention; astern, under the muzzle
of a gun that had rung into history
that May morning in Manila Bay,
was an awning; beneath it something
flag-draped&mdash;Dick. The woman shook
in a tearless sob. Dick. What was it
all&mdash;all the glory that the nations,
that America could heap on him,
when&mdash;ah, Dick! She seemed to see
his eyes and the deep look in them as
he turned by the tulip-bed and kissed
his hands to her&mdash;as the Cloudless
Sulphurs stormed up from the clover
around his blond head. Dick! Her
little, laughing Dick&mdash;her big, loving
Dick. Then she was aware of a
gun crashing, a band playing a dirge&mdash;the
gun crashing again into the
music; it was the “minute-guns of
sorrow” they were firing. And then
suddenly&mdash;a shrill sound and a heart-stirring&mdash;as
they lifted the coffin to
the gangway, the boatswain, in the
old ceremony of the sea, “piped his
comrade over the side.” Step by
slow step they carried the lad down
and the boatswain’s whistle called
piercingly again as Dick, high on the
shoulders of eight uniformed men,
reached shore. Dick was home. The
coffin wound between the lines of
troops and marines, toward the gun-carriage,
and the rigid young bluejackets
far above watched still at attention,
and with that a bugler blew
flourishes and the band broke into
the “Star-Spangled Banner,” the nation’s
hymn. And still the minute-guns
crashed through. And packed
thousands of plain American citizens
waited bareheaded for hours in the
cold rain to see this beloved boy of
America carried by.</p>

<p>Many people remarked the slender,
tall woman in her billowy black veil
with the gold star on her arm. Some
spoke of her. “A wonderful face,”
they said, and: “Her eyes are burning
her up.” And more than one
thought: “Who knows? It may be
her boy.”</p>

<p>After that she stood hour after hour
in a shadowy doorway of a large
chamber and watched a marvellous
procession file past, four abreast.
Hour after hour. Without ceasing
they came; it was as if the country
poured itself out in one draft of
love. Sometimes a group halted and
there was a short ceremony. She saw
the President place the silver shield
with its forty-eight gold stars; she
saw the Boy Scouts, fresh-faced,
sturdy lads such as Dick had been
five or six years ago, form and recite
their oath by Dick’s coffin; she saw
the embassies of England, of France,
and Italy bring wreaths for Dick;
she saw the ancient Indian fighters,
led by General Miles, and the Belgians
with their palm, and the old
man of ninety-one who wore his old
Victoria Cross, and Pershing, laying
down his wreath and stepping back to
salute his soldier, and the Chinese
and the Japanese with their antique
bowing, and the white-turbaned Hindus,
and ever and ever the plain
Americans in their thousands, “his
own people from every nook of the
nation, who gave him his reward.”</p>

<p>The short gray day faded and night
came and still the crowds poured, and
Dick’s mother stood, still, unconscious
of fatigue, and saw, as in a
dream, the pageant, till the last ones
allowed to come in had passed out
and the swaying woman in black
went also, and the boy was alone with
his guard of five comrades, “his head
eastward toward France and at his
feet the twinkling lights of Washington.”
Far above him on the great
dome of the Capitol the brooding
figure of Freedom, his comrade also,
watched.</p>

<p>Shortly after daylight next morning
the tramp of marching men and clatter
of hoofs and grinding of wheels
before the Capitol told that the greatest
parade of American history was
forming, and the khaki tide rolled
into ordered ranks. The woman saw
this beginning, very early in the
morning. She was there before the
bugle sounded attention across the
plaza and the cavalrymen snapped
out their sabres and the infantrymen
came to present and the officers to
salute and the colors were dipped&mdash;and
the sun sent a beam to Freedom
on the dome and another to a casket
moving through the doorway. She
saw it carried down the long steps by
the bravest of the brave, all decorated
men, and placed on the black-draped
caisson with its black horses,
and its soldiers sat on their scarlet
saddle-cloths. She saw that, and she
saw the President and “Black Jack”
Pershing, Commander-in-Chief of the
A. E. F., following as chief mourners&mdash;Pershing
wearing, of all his decorations,
only the Victory Medal to
which every American soldier has a
right&mdash;the caisson where lay&mdash;Dick.
She saw the crowds dense up Pennsylvania
Avenue, the historic road
“where the tramping ghosts of
Grant’s legions marked a course.”
She saw the silent, attentive thousands
who packed the sidewalks,
standing there to take their part in
what was theirs, the glory of the
American people. “Out in the broad
avenue was a simple soldier, dead for
the honor of the flag. In France he
had died as Americans have always
been ready to die, for the flag and
what it meant.” The woman saw the
massed, reverent faces, and read this
in them.</p>

<p>“It’s Dick,” she said.</p>

<p>Later, not remembering very much
how she had come, she found herself
at Arlington, at the Amphitheatre,
with yet more thousands. There were
bright colors of foreign dress uniforms
and masses of khaki and light
and shadow and the snowy gleam of
columns against a background of
trees. Later there was distant, solemn
music through the trees. From the
direction of the fort the dim color
of troops came nearer and nearer,
clearer and clearer; the marine band,
half-step to the throb of drums,
swung out and circled the colonnade.
The caisson rolled up where a white-surpliced
choir waited, and men in
uniform with medals on their breasts
lifted Dick, and the choir sang “The
Son of God Goes Forth to War.”
They carried him past the troops with
rifles at “present,” past the bareheaded
people, through the pillared
colonnade, with the white choir and
the clergy leading them, the great
of many lands awaiting him. They
placed him on a catafalque, flower-covered,
and the great audience, all
the thousands, rose and stood as
he passed in&mdash;Dick&mdash;with Pershing
still following, Pershing who had
trudged seven miles from the Capitol
behind his soldier.</p>

<p>The coffin rested on its base as if
held up by a mound of blossoms&mdash;and
suddenly the woman felt stabbed
with a knife, a frantic, unbearable
feeling. Her boy lay there with no
sign of her near him. The nation had
heaped him with honor, but Dick
would not be satisfied with the nation,
missing his mother. In her hand
was a bunch of roses; she wondered
where she had gotten them, and
vaguely recalled a florist’s shop on
the way out. She sprang toward a
guard, a soldier, and the man stared
at her as people did.</p>

<p>“Put these&mdash;put these&mdash;right close
to him,” she begged in sliding Southern
speech. “He’s&mdash;he’s my boy.”
The soldier little guessed how literal
the words were to her, but they went
direct to his heart. A boy of hers lay
in France; this one stood for him; so
he understood it. “Yes, ma’am,” he
said gently.</p>

<p>He took the flowers and went away
with them and in a moment she saw
them laid on the coffin, their white
heads against a gorgeous wreath of
red roses. The President’s red roses&mdash;but
the woman did not know that.
The man came back then and found
her a place in one of the first rows of
the curving line of seats where were
only men and women in black.</p>

<p>The mighty service went on. The
woman going through it with the
others seemed aware of it through
another’s senses, as if she were removed
where her consciousness could
not make contact with anything
earthly. This was Dick’s funeral, but
she was not sad. Only fused to a
hazy exaltation. Maybe Dick’s light-hearted
spirit was there, hovering
over all this and lifting her spirit with
him. In any case her flowers lay close
to him, clinging whitely against that
blood-red wreath. They must be, she
was guessing, just above where the
withered little French roses rested
still on Dick’s dear cold heart. To
see them there brought a manner of
comfort to her. And the service went
on. As Bishop Brent’s voice ended,
the bells over in Washington were
ringing noon, and sharply the clear,
high notes of a trumpeter blew attention.
She stood up with the thousands,
the millions, the nation. For
the nation paused during two minutes
then to honor&mdash;Dick. All over
America, in churches, in marketplaces,
on railway lines, the rushing
life of the country stopped and the
populace stood silent with bowed
heads for that tremendous moment,
honoring the men who had died.</p>

<p>Then it was over; a minute-gun
boomed across the river at the base of
the Washington Monument; led by
the band the stirred multitude swung
into “America.”</p>

<p>“My country, ’tis of thee,” the people
sang. And the woman sang with
them. She could; she was dry-eyed
and calm; this was Dick’s funeral,
her little boy Dick, her splendid, big
son. Yet she seemed to feel nothing.
The Lord God was going to give her
a sign that it was Dick. She was
anxious about that. Certain, yes, of
course; but a sign was to come.
Nervousness caught her as the President
began to speak; she wished the
Lord God would hurry; it would do
at any time, surely, yet this strain
of waiting was difficult. It was hard
to listen to the President while one
was watching every moment for the
sign. And with that his voice had
slipped into words as familiar as her
own name, words which she had
taught to Dick.</p>

<p>“Our Father which art in Heaven&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>There was a soft, many-rustling
sound of thousands rising, and all the
voices took up the age-old words:</p>

<p>“Hallowed be Thy Name&mdash;Thy
will be done.”</p>

<p>Yes, indeed. The Lord God knew
that she had bowed to His will, even
as to that word “missing.” She supposed
it was His will. She had borne
it, somehow. But now that Dick was
dead, and carried home all these
miles, bringing peace in his quiet
hands, <i>now</i> the Lord God ought to
give her the sign. He ought, really.
With that a quartet was singing
something about how</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse outdent">“Splendid they passed, the great surrender made</div>
<div class="verse">Into the light that nevermore shall fade.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Oh, yes. But one doesn’t care so
much about splendor and unfading
light&mdash;when one misses Dick. The
comforting thing was that Dick was
to bring peace&mdash;peace forever. He
would care about that; that would
make him glad. And there was going
to be a sign that this boy, this Unknown
Soldier coming from his grave
in France at the very moment of the
Peace Conference&mdash;that this boy was
Dick. How could she be otherwise
than restless till the sign came?</p>

<p>Back of the carved, calm face in
which the gray Irish eyes glowed
such thoughts were seething. Lawyers
weighing evidence would hardly
have found her argument valid. The
desperate brain which made them
more than half knew the sophistry.
But the brain <i>was</i> desperate. One
cannot face the word “missing” for
many months and keep coolly logical.
This was the last straw to hold her to
sanity&mdash;that Dick was the Peace
Bringer; that this boy was Dick.
These things she must believe. Must.</p>

<p>Quietly she gazed as minute by
splendid minute passed, each crowded
with such things as America has
never seen before. She watched an
officer in uniform, a “Sam Browne”
belt across his breast, step forward.
What were they going to do now?
The officer shifted the flowers toward
the foot, and she gasped as the President’s
great red wreath was moved;
her roses were next; it was too bad to
take her roses away from Dick. But
see&mdash;they were left. The officer
touched them, and left them; the
little sheaf was not in the way. But
what was going to happen? He rolled
back the flag with its heavy gold
fringe, and with that the President
stood there and was reading something&mdash;citations&mdash;reverently,
in his
incisive voice; then he bent and
pinned two precious things to the
black cloth of the coffin&mdash;the Distinguished
Service Cross and that
which Americans believe the highest
decoration in the world, the Congressional
Medal of Honor. How
pleased Dick would have been!</p>

<p>“Won in mortality to be worn in
immortality,” spoke the President.</p>

<p>Was Dick’s gay spirit maybe even
now hovering, watching it all, smiling
the sweet, half-shy, one-sided
smile she knew, laughing at himself
a bit for being the centre of this stupendous
ceremony? In quick succession
one brilliant uniform succeeded
another by the narrow box, each fastening
to the black cloth an honor
which men have died to win. Something
contracted her throat with a
short sob when General Jacques, the
Belgian, unpinned from his own coat
the Cross of War which his King had
put there and placed it on Dick’s
coffin. And was not that Foch who
swept off his white-plumed Marshal’s
hat before the presence of&mdash;Dick?
How Dick would have taken in the
scarlet baldric, the gold sash, and
red trousers! Dick had an enormous
enthusiasm for Foch; once he had
seen him&mdash;a solemn old fellow in a
faded horizon-blue uniform and very
muddy boots, the letter said. Smoking
a pipe.</p>

<p>Medal after medal; such an array as
the greatest soldier on earth had
never worn. They rolled back the flag
over it all till the judgment day, and
Sergeant Woodfill and the seven
other heroes lifted Dick again and
carried him down the marble steps.
The band was playing “Our Honored
Dead”; she raised her eyes and
saw the city across the river; the
dome of the Capitol under which
Dick had slept last night; where
only dead Presidents had ever slept
before; nearer was the yellow of
ploughed Virginia fields and the green
of winter wheat; about them the
snowy white of the great Amphitheatre,
and directly beneath the boy as
they carried him around was “a great
splash of black&mdash;thousands of Americans
with hats held in their hands.”
Between these and the Amphitheatre
was a white place with a hole in it.
Dick’s grave. She moved dreamily
toward that place, and people stood
back for the black, lonely figure with
its gold star. Unconscious of them,
she passed till she was close enough
to see everything.</p>

<p>“It will be now, I think,” she was
saying. “The Lord God will send His
sign when they put Dick&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The rest of the words couldn’t be
framed. Of course Dick’s soul wasn’t
there; it was somewhere about, above,
close&mdash;much interested and a good
deal amused as well as thrilled; she
felt that. This was only Dick’s body
they were putting away covered with
medals and flowers, laid on that priceless
earth brought from France, scattered
down for him to rest on. It was
only his body. But such a precious,
dear body; it had been so warm and
strong&mdash;Oh, God! She alone out of
the thousands knew that it was Dick,
and even she&mdash;The Lord God certainly
was slow about sending His
sign.</p>

<p>The beautiful church service was
read; Dick’s soul was committed to
God and his body to the grave.
Some one touched a silver bar and
the coffin sank slowly; a man in uniform
placed a final wreath&mdash;from all
the men of all our fighting armies.
Then an old Indian in magnificence
of chief’s feathers hobbled up and
took off his sweeping war-bonnet,
whose white feathers trailed to his
moccasins, and laid it with a sort of
stick across the open tomb. It was
the last tribute. The warrior of ancient
America saluted America’s warrior
of to-day. A salvo of artillery.
Another salvo&mdash;and another. The
woman stared about. Dick would
bivouac to-night in great company.
All around him were monuments cut
with names that were echoes of
thunder of guns. There lay Porter
and Crook; yonder lay Dewey. The
slope carries along innumerable headstones;
over the ridge are the grass
ramparts of old Fort Myer, graves
thick about them; she sensed these
things as the guns rang the salvoes.</p>

<p>The guns had stopped; a bugler,
standing out, was playing “Taps”&mdash;the
soldier’s good night. With the
final silver note the artillery broke
into the roar of the national salute of
twenty-one guns. The crowds moved,
shifted, thinned. The bright uniforms
scattered and disappeared. But the
tall, black figure stood there, conscious
of the people only as a swimmer
in deep water is conscious of the
waves. She was in them, of them,
but they had no personality for her.
Slowly the huge audience spread
away through the trees. The pageant
was over. The pageant&mdash;what matter
was that? Dick; Dick was dead and
buried, and she stood by the grave
of an Unknown Soldier and reproached
God. He had sent her no
sign that this boy was hers. Down
among the new white crosses in the
cemetery below moved figures; there
are always figures moving among
those crosses&mdash;but the woman felt
herself alone. All the pomp and ceremony
being finished, she was alone
with her boy. She knelt near the new
grave; the black veil blew about her,
covering and uncovering the gold star
on her sleeve.</p>

<p>“God,” she whispered, “bless the
men to-morrow who are trying to
bring peace. I don’t know whether
they know that it’s Dick who’s bringing
it or not. I don’t care. I know,
God, and You know. Only let Dick
be the Peace Bringer, and let an
American speak the master word. I
thought the sign would be to-day, but
I’ll be patient if it isn’t to be to-day.
But, mighty God, don’t fail me in the
end. You know how I couldn’t bear
that. It means having Dick again&mdash;ever&mdash;somehow&mdash;I
can’t say it well,
but you’re God and You know how
those things are tied together. Peace
and Dick’s immortality and the sign.
Be merciful; give it to me.”</p>

<p>A week later in Kentucky blunt little
Lynnette was reasoning with her.
“You can’t expect to set a date with
the Almighty,” reasoned Lynnette.
“I think it will come&mdash;I do think so,
though I don’t know why I think it.
Only that such a longing as yours
focussed on one thing must be a
psychological force. And, whatever
God is, He does answer prayer somehow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, He does,” said the woman. “Wasn’t Hughes’ word sent straight
as lightning from heaven? It came
the day after the funeral&mdash;Dick’s funeral.
It came out of Dick’s tomb. I
can’t help believing the good Lord
did plan, along with the salvation of
the nations, to make Dick His Peace
Bringer.” She waited a moment,
eyes glowing with deep light. Then:
“‘Whatsoever ye ask in My name,
believing, ye shall receive it.’” A
thousand times she had repeated
that.</p>

<p>Lynnette nodded practically. “Uh-huh,
that says it. God certainly did
stir up Hughes when he got off that
proposition. Why shouldn’t we believe
it was partly, anyhow, the huge
emotion of the Unknown Soldier that
pushed him? The sign may come in
some shape you’re not dreaming.
Likely it will&mdash;but it’ll come. I’m
sure.”</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine in what shape&mdash;that
terrifies me at times. It seems
so impossible. And if it shouldn’t
come!”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t think that,” rebuked
Lynnette. “It depends so
much on psychology, and your will
may be a big part. You don’t have to
imagine what it will be. Yet I&mdash;do
imagine things.”</p>

<p>“You do? What?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” Lynnette answered slowly,
“nothing definite. Sometimes I
fancy that the identity wasn’t lost
to everybody, over in France. That
maybe the soldiers who&mdash;who brought
the four boys from the cemeteries
found something to mark them, or
one of them, and just said nothing
about it. Maybe one of those soldiers
might come to you. Why,” exploded
Lynnette, “two or three times
when I’ve seen a young, military-looking
chap coming down this street
my heart has been in my mouth. I’ve
said: ‘He’s the sign.’”</p>

<p>“You have?” cried the woman.
And then, with her arms reaching:
“You little Lynnette! You loved
Dick.”</p>

<p>Lynnette nodded. “And Dick&mdash;loved
me,” she whispered.</p>

<p>She sprang up, and was gone. Outside
she stopped a moment, staring at
the sodden, round spot, half filled
with snow, which had been a bed of
dancing tulips.</p>

<p>“I wonder if it’s a crime,” she reflected.
“The engine skips. There’s no
logic anywhere. But she’d go raving
mad. And I love her.” Little, aggressive
Lynnette flushed all by herself.
“Dick left me, in a sort of way, to his
mother. He said: ‘Be sweet to her,
Lynnette.’ Well,” Lynnette ended
defiantly, “I reckon I can lie a good
while longer, if it helps her.”</p>

<p>It is queer, considering what a small
accident and what a second of time
may end a life, that so many lives
weather appalling shocks and years
of heart-break. The woman, going
softly with an ear alert always to
catch a message, found that winter
was past and spring coming in overnight
jumps to her Southern land.
With it the restlessness of spring
crystallized into an overwhelming necessity
to see the white tomb at Arlington.
It was imperative, that desire.
There was no money for travelling
expenses, but some old mahogany
went to a dealer, and on an April day
she started. Spring comes easily in
the South. It is much as if the lover
you doubted turned all at once his
face toward you lighted with the fire
unmistakable, and you wondered in
the warm flood of happiness if ever
you did doubt. So in the turn of a
hand in that God’s country there are
vivid colors of tulips and jonquils and
hyacinths&mdash;gold and purple and pink&mdash;and
the hedges are dim with mists
of juicy color, and the lawns have
sprung to emerald, and the sunlight
stipples the ground with gold laughter
through the lace of boughs. And
one wonders if ever there was melting
snow and cold wind. Out at Arlington
the sunlight played gaily on the
headstones among the trees, dancing
about the solemn things as if to say
that, after all, life is only a moment;
that it is sweet and fitting to die for
one’s country, and that these light-hearted
dead should be kept in bright
memory. Till it came to the snow
of the Amphitheatre and the white
tomb on the terrace, and there the
sunlight seemed to pour itself out in
full-hearted golden tide. Dreamily,
mystically, smilingly it wrapped in
its arms the grave of America’s boy.
All about the tomb the grass seemed
greener, and the air of a richer sweetness.
Fold on fold the calm hills
dropped away to the Virginia horizon;
the mast of the <i>Maine</i> brought
from Havana shot its slender spire
beyond the Amphitheatre; the old
house of history, the pillared, porticoed
house of the Lees, peered out
from the woods like a big, gentle,
dumb creature, watching in its old
age its family who had fought and
come through to Peace.</p>

<p>The woman scattered a quantity of
yellow tulips on the grave till it was
all golden with them. “God,” she
prayed, kneeling close&mdash;closer than
she could be in November&mdash;“God,
I’ve come such a long way. I’ve
waited such a long time. Only You
can give what I’ve come for. I want
it so. Give me Your sign.” A long
time the black figure knelt amidst the
whiteness and greenness and spring
gaiety. Many things she prayed, and
at the last for power to give up hope.
For there was yet no sign. Perhaps
there never would be. Sobbing a little,
she bent and kissed the yellow
tulips, and turned to go.</p>

<p>As she drifted away step by step
suddenly the bells over in Washington
were ringing the noon-hour, and
she faced about, remembering. As
she turned, up from the grass below,
over the white edge of the terrace,
stormed a fluttering mass of bright
wings, and filled all the air with beckoning
gold. A moment they hung,
twinkling over the tomb, and then
fell, brilliant, incredible, and lighted
on the gold cups of the tulips, and
flickering, dancing, gathered the sunlight
into their myriad wings.</p>

<p>The Cloudless Sulphurs; Dick’s butterflies;
the symbol of immortality.
The sign.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
